Over the past Snail IDE has had many controversies (mostly me (Mr_rudy), being dumb since I didn't understand licenses that much back then, but now I understand it more.)
Funny enough I have to say thank you to G1nx for saying something, it made me realize that I messed up.
Also thank you JeremyGamer13 for still being supportive even though I messed up so many times.
I understand people getting angry over the extension theift, I have asked every creator of the extensions that I wasn't sure if they were cool with the extensions being there, and so currently we are fine. If you have an issue with an extension, please just tell me.
